You have won the 1872 Presidential Election.</h3><p>“I’d like to thank everyone in this hall for your generous contributions to the campaign!” The people cheer.</p><p>“I’d like to thank Mr. Colfax for giving us so much to work against in the coming years!’ The people laugh.</p><p>“And of course I’d like to thank PRESIDENT ELECT Seward, for making me the Vice Presidential Elect!” Charles Adams smiled widely as you approached the front of the parlor room. Around you sat the Massechuets gentry, Mr. Adams’ closest allies. In some ways you felt trapped. As Adams squeezed your hand tightly you approached the front and smiled.</p><p>“Well, uh. Many say our nation has just witnessed a shift in national politics! Ahem. With the help of Mr. Adams, our great party is forever changed as well! I’m sure many of you have heard of the corrupt Colfax and his departure from the party…”</p><p>You froze for a moment and tried to gather your words. You couldn’t help but think about your father in his discourse with President Linclon. You had never seen a more divisive and trying time. Nor had you seen two men respectfully disagree like they did. Yet they held the party and the whole damn country together like glue.</p><p>You thought you couldn’t do the same. As you returned to the dinner party, you again looked at the people in front of you. You smiled.</p><p>“I’m sorry I must’ve jumbled my words!”</p>",

THE HERO OF GETTYSBURG TO HEAD TO D.C.”</p><p>You would most certainly be lying to yourself if you said it didn’t sting a little. After all, it had only been seven years since… since you know what. Already the democrats were taking the White House back. Most certainly your reputation and career were eternally destroyed. The whole damn Republican party was now at eachothers throats, Adams blaming Colfax for the loss and vise versa.</p><p>That being said as you reclined back into your chair, pipe in hand, you felt in some ways… relieved? Perhaps this business wasn’t cut out for you anyways. Adams’ fiery rhetoric was never inspiring and Colfax was a corrupt bastard anyway. Some men will probably call you weak and ineffective. Whether that is true or not isn’t necessarily what you want to ponder. </p><p>As you look at the early morning turn closer to the afternoon in the distance, you think about your father. That terrible night. You take a deep breath and wonder if he would be proud. What you conclude is unknown, perhaps even to you, as you head inside for breakfast.",
